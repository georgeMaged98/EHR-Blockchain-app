# Blockchain Healthcare project

The project aims at investigating the world of blockchain and building a simple application for a healthcare system.
Healthcare professionals can register themselves as clinics/doctors. They can add patients to their clinic and for each patient they can record their visits as well as medical mesurements and prescriptions, medications and doses. This helps healthcare professionals get all the medical history of the patient. 
The blockchain technology (Ethereum) is used as  a database to store details of doctors, patients and medical records. Blockchain ensures authentication but it does not ensure confidentiality. Hence, encryption is used to ensure confidentiality. The data is stored encrypted in the blockchain and is decrypted after fetching it from the blockchain.

* We use hardhat to manage smart contracts and the blockchain. 
* A user interface is implemented using react.
